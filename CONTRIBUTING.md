   ```

### Project Structure

- `Sources/` - Main source code
  - `Models/` - Data models and structures
  - `Services/` - Core business logic and services
  - `Views/` - SwiftUI views and UI components
- `Tests/` - Unit tests
- `Documentation/` - Additional documentation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow standard Swift conventions:

- Use Swift 6 syntax and features
- Follow SwiftUI best practices
- Use `@MainActor` for UI-related code
- Implement proper error handling
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### Example Code Style:

```swift
/// Service for managing IMAP connections and email backup operations
@MainActor
class IMAPService: ObservableObject {
    @Published var connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus = .disconnected
    
    /// Connects to the IMAP server with the provided credentials
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - account: The email account to connect to
    /// - Returns: Success or failure result
    func connect(to account: Account) async -> Result<Void, IMAPError> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:
```
Add Gmail OAuth2 authentication support

Implement backup progress cancellation

Fix memory leak in IMAP connection handling

Update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Test on multiple macOS versions when possible
- Include integration tests for IMAP functionality

## Contributing Process

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being discussed
2. **Open an issue** to discuss new features or significant changes
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   swift test
   swift build -c release
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"
   ```

### Submitting Changes

1. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Test results

3. **Address review feedback** promptly

## Architecture Guidelines

### SwiftUI Views

- Keep views focused and single-purpose
- Use `@StateObject` for view-owned objects
- Use `@EnvironmentObject` for shared state
- Extract reusable components

### Services

- Use actor isolation for thread safety
- Implement proper error handling
- Use dependency injection for testing
- Follow single responsibility principle

### Data Models

- Use `Codable` for persistence
- Implement proper equality and hashing
- Use value types when appropriate
- Add validation logic

## Security Considerations

When contributing:

- Never commit passwords or API keys
- Use Keychain for sensitive data storage
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure communication protocols
- Follow macOS security guidelines

## Building and Testing

### Local Development

```bash
# Build in debug mode
swift build

# Build in release mode
swift build -c release

# Run tests
swift test

# Run with Xcode
open Package.swift
```

### Creating App Bundle

```bash
# After building
mkdir -p "IMAP Backup.app/Contents/MacOS"
cp ".build/release/IMAP-Backup-macOS" "IMAP Backup.app/Contents/MacOS/IMAP Backup"
```

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers in `Package.swift` and `Info.plist`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new features and fixes
3. Create a release tag
4. Build and test the release candidate
